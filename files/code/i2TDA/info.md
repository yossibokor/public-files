- gudhi.hera
- sklearn

To run the `Contours` notebook, you will additionally need :
- [correa](https://correa.yossi.eu)

Some useful links include:
- [Applied Algebraic Topology Research Network](https://www.youtube.com/c/AppliedAlgebraicTopologyNetwork) YouTube account has lots of videos about TDA. In particular the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dF_ZtUTPRk) where Henry Adams presents the Persistent Homology Algorithm by doing an example.
